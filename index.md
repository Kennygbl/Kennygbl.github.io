The aim of this project is to create a Machine Leraning model to predict if a patient should be diagnosed with heart disease. Various models such as LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier, Support vector Machine (SVM) were used with RandomForest giving the most accuracy. We were also able to determine which factors are most important for predicting heart disease diagnosis.
